              Hello! I'm Muriel Sánchez Laguna, a front-end developer with a
              passion for continuous learning and creating seamless user
              experiences. As someone who believes in the saying,
            </p>

              <strong>"You are always a student, never a master", </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm constantly striving to improve my skills and explore new
              technologies. My journey into coding has been driven by a genuine
              curiosity for how digital products are built and a desire to
              contribute to impactful web projects. I thrive on turning ideas
              into reality through clean, efficient code, and I'm excited to
              continue growing as a front-end developer. <br />
              <br />
              I originally studied electromechanical engineering, where I gained
              a strong technical foundation, and later completed a master's
              degree in project management. This combination of engineering and
              project management has equipped me with a unique skill set that I
              now bring to my front-end work. My experience in managing complex
              projects has helped me develop a strategic mindset, ensuring that
              I not only focus on delivering great user experiences but also on
              meeting project goals efficiently and effectively. <br /><br />
              As a Panamanian professional, I'm eager to leverage my diverse
              background in remote front-end roles, contributing to innovative
              digital projects. I’m excited by the challenges that come with
              building responsive, user-friendly applications, and I look
              forward to collaborating on dynamic projects where I can apply my
              technical skills, creativity, and love for learning.
